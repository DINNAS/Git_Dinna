Overview

About the Cloud Native Computing Foundation Certification Program
The Cloud Native Computing Foundation is committed to growing the community of Kubernetes Administrators and Application Developers, thereby allowing continued growth of Kubernetes-related activities across the broad set of companies and organizations that are using Kubernetes. Certification is a key step in that process, allowing certified Administrators and Application Developers to quickly establish their credibility and value in the job market, and also allowing companies to more quickly hire highly-qualified teams to support their growth.

Scope of Certifications
The Cloud Native Computing Foundation offers a certification program that allows users to demonstrate their competence in a hands-on, command-line environment.

The purpose of the Certified Kubernetes Administrator (CKA) certification is to provide assurance that certification holders have the skills, knowledge and competency to perform the responsibilities of Kubernetes Administrators.

The purpose of the Certified Kubernetes Application Developer (CKAD) certification is to provide assurance that CKADs have the skills, knowledge, and competency to perform the responsibilities of Kubernetes application developers. A Certified Kubernetes Application Developer can define application resources and use core primitives to build, monitor, and troubleshoot scalable applications and tools in Kubernetes.

To achieve certification, a candidate will need to pass a performance-based exam that tests their Kubernetes Administrator and Application Developer skills. For exam security, candidates must verify their identity and are monitored by a proctor during the exam session via streaming audio, video, and screensharing feeds. The screensharing feed allows proctors to view
candidates' desktops (including all monitors). The audio, video, and screen sharing feeds will be stored for a limited period of time in the event that there is a subsequent need for review. Certification is issued upon a candidate passing the required exam.

The CKA and CKAD Certifications focus on the skills required to be a successful Kubernetes Administrator or Application Developer in industry today.

This CKA exam curriculum includes these general domains and their weights on the exam: ●   Application Lifecycle Management 8%
●   Installation, Configuration & Validation 12%
●   Core Concepts 19%
●   Networking 11%
●   Scheduling 5%
●   Security 12%



 

 

 

 

 

 
●   Cluster Maintenance 11%
●   Logging / Monitoring 5%
●   Storage 7%
●   Troubleshooting 10%

This CKAD exam curriculum includes these general domains and their weights on the exam: ●   Core Concepts 13%
●   Configuration 18%
●   Multi-Container Pods 10%
●   Observability 18%
●   Pod Design 20%
●   Services & Networking 13%
●   State Persistence 8%

Candidate Requirements

Testing Equipment: Hardware and Environment
Exams are delivered online and closely monitored by proctors via webcam, audio, and remote screen viewing. Candidates must provide their own front-end hardware to take exams, including a computer with:
●   Chrome or Chromium browser ●   reliable internet access
●   webcam
●   microphone

The workstation on which the hardware (i.e. desktop or laptop) is placed must, aside from the required hardware, reveal a clean surface with no obstructions overhead or underneath. Candidates should ensure that their webcam is capable of being moved in case the proctor requests that the Candidate pan their surroundings to check for potential violations of exam policy.
●   If multiple Candidates are taking an exam at the same time in one location, then at least four feet (1.2 meters) of empty space on all sides must be enforced or privacy partitions must be installed.


Hardware Compatibility Check

Candidates should run the compatibility check tool provided by the Exam Proctoring Partner to verify that their hardware meets the minimum requirements. The tool is located at https://www.examslocal.com/ScheduleExam/Home/CompatibilityCheck. Select “Linux Foundation” as the Exam Sponsor and “CKA” or “CKAD” as the Exam. (At this time, only Chrome and Chromium browsers are supported.)




 

 

 

 

 

 
Candidate Identification and Authentication
Candidates are required to provide government-issued photo identification before the Exam can be launched. Any current, non-expired government ID containing Candidate’s photo and full name of Candidate in the Latin alphabet may be used for identity verification. Examples of acceptable forms of government-issued photo ID include, but are not limited to:
●   passport
●   government-issued driver’s license/permit ●   national identity card
●   state- or province-issued identity card

If a current, non-expired government ID containing Candidate’s photo and full name of Candidate in the Latin alphabet is not available, the candidate may provide to the proctor a notarized English translation of the ID along with the non-Latin character photo ID.

If you have questions about whether your photo ID is acceptable please contact: certificationsupport@cncf.io.


Eligibility
Candidates must test as an individual. Certification is only available for natural persons, not corporations or other legal entities.


Age
Candidates must be 18 years of age or older to be eligible for testing or certification. Candidates under the age of 18 years old are considered underage minors and are not eligible for testing or certification even with parental consent. The Cloud Native Computing Foundation reserves the right to impose additional restrictions to comply with local data protection laws.


Accommodations for Special Needs
If a candidate has special needs that need to be taken into account during exam administration, they must notify the Cloud Native Computing Foundation at least two (2) weeks in advance so any accommodating measures can arranged.


Statement of Non-Discrimination
The Cloud Native Computing Foundation endorses the principles of equal opportunity. Eligibility criteria for certification as a Certified Kubernetes Administrator (CKA) or Certified Kubernetes Application Developer (CKAD) is applied equally to all individuals regardless of age, race, religion, gender, national origin, veteran status, or disability.




 

 

 

 

 

 

 
Certification and Confidentiality Agreement
Candidates are required to accept the terms of the Cloud Native Computing Foundation Certification and Confidentiality Agreement located at https://www.cncf.io/certification/agreement/. This is a legally-binding agreement that applies to all exams. Acceptance and adherence to this agreement is required in order to be exposed to the exam and to be officially certified. Candidates must first accept the terms and conditions of the Cloud Native Computing Foundation Certification and Confidentiality Agreement during the registration process and again prior to testing. Failure to accept the terms of this agreement will result in a terminated exam and forfeiture of the entire exam fee.

Exam Prep Checklist
If the Exam Prep Checklist is displayed, it indicates a candidate has taken the first step of registering for an exam, but still has more steps to complete (e.g. scheduling an exam date) before they can take the exam. Candidates should use the Exam Prep Checklist to review and complete the steps necessary to take the exam. When items in the checklist have been completed, a green checkmark will appear next to the item. Red crosses indicate items which remain to be completed.

The items on the Exam Prep Checklist include the following:

●   Register for Exam
●   Check System Requirements ●   Schedule Exam
●   Get Candidate Handbook ●   Verify Name
●   Important Tips ●   Take Exam

The “help” next to each item can be clicked on to get more information on a specific item/step.

Register for Exam
Register for Exam will already be checked as complete when the Exam Prep Checklist is presented.


Check System Requirements
Candidates must check that the system on which they plan to take their exam meets the minimum requirements for taking the exam. Clicking on the Check System Requirements link in the Exam Prep Checklist will direct a candidate to a Compatibility Check Tool. To use the tool, the candidate should select “Linux Foundation” as the Exam Sponsor and “CKA” or “CKAD” as the Exam. The tool will allow the candidate to determine if their system meets the minimum requirements or if anything is needed to bring their system up to the required specifications.

The portal cannot determine the results of the Compatibility Check Tool; it can only determine if the candidate has accessed the tool by clicking on the Check System Requirements link provided in the Exam Prep Checklist.

If the Compatibility Check Tool reveals that a candidate’s system does not meet minimum requirements, it is the candidate’s responsibility to bring their system up to the necessary specifications or to procure a system that does meet the minimum requirements before they take their exam.




 

 

 

 

 

 
Candidates may access the Check System Requirements link even after it has been marked as complete. This allows candidates to re-check a system after changes have been made or to check new systems.


Schedule Exam
Use the Schedule Exam link to be directed and automatically logged in to the Exam Proctoring Partner’s scheduling site. Once authenticated and logged in, candidates may search for the exam by Exam Title, Code (CKA or CKAD) or Sponsor Name (The Linux Foundation) and they can then select from available Dates and Times* for an exam reservation.

During scheduling, candidates will also be prompted to use the Check Compatibility Tool to confirm that their system meets minimum requirements needed for the exam, and to read and accept the terms of the Cloud Native Computing Foundation Certification and Confidentiality Agreement. Once all steps have been completed successfully, the exam reservation will be confirmed. Email notification will be sent to the candidate regarding their confirmed exam reservation. (Candidates who have set up exclusive email whitelists should add http://it.psionline.com to their list of acceptable domains.)

*Please note that exams require a 24-hour lead time to allow for preparation of the virtual machines, so the earliest possible reservation date will be the following business day. Additionally, the latest possible date possible in the scheduling calendar is 60 days out. If a later reservation is desired, candidate will need to wait until their desired date is less than 60 days
out to schedule.


Canceling or Rescheduling
Once a candidate has scheduled an exam reservation, they may cancel or reschedule the reservation up to 24 hours before the start time of the reservation. Reservation changes are not possible within 24 hours before the start time. No-shows forfeit the money paid for an exam registration.

Candidates should refer to the Cancel and Reschedule Instructions provided in the exam reservation confirmation email from the Exam Proctoring Partner, or follow the steps below:
●   Login to www.examslocal.com/linuxfoundation with your Linux Foundation ID ●   Click on "My Exams"
●   Click on the scheduled Exam and then click on Cancel or Reschedule button


Get Candidate Handbook
All candidates are expected to read and familiarize themselves with this Candidate Handbook. In My Portal, Candidates may click on the Get Candidate Handbook to access the Handbook. Once the link is clicked on, the item is marked as completed. Candidates may access the





 

 

 

 

 
Download Candidate Handbook link even after it has been marked as completed. This allows Candidates to re-download or review the Candidate Handbook at later dates if needed.

Exam Description

Certification exams from the Cloud Native Computing Foundation require the candidate to use the command line to demonstrate their competencies across the specified domains. Exams are delivered entirely online and closely monitored by proctors via webcam, audio, and remote screen viewing. This gives Candidates the freedom to take their exam at the place and time of their choosing (subject to meeting the conditions stipulated in Candidate Requirements section of this document).

There is no need for the candidate to install or have Linux running on their local machine. Instead, a server is provisioned for the candidate’s use during the exam. The candidate logs into an exam console via a web browser; within that console, the candidate will communicate with the proctor, view exam questions/objectives, and access the server provisioned for their use during the exam.






 

 

 

 

 

 
Launching Exam
At the time of a candidate’s scheduled exam reservation, the candidate can login to My Portal and click on the Take Exam link to be directed to the Exam Proctoring Partner’s site. Candidates may also go to the URL provided in the confirmation and reminder emails from the Exam Proctoring Partner, which is https://www.examslocal.com/linuxfoundation. The candidate will be prompted to authenticate via their Linux Foundation ID login.

Once authenticated and logged in, the candidate should click on My Exams, select the appropriate exam listed in the left margin, and click the Launch Exam button (see Reporting Issues with Launching Exam). Clicking the Launch Exam button will open the Exam Console in a new browser tab and the candidate may then close all other tabs and browsers.

Once in the Exam Console, the candidate will be prompted through a check-in process by the proctor. The check-in process includes the following:
●   sharescreen, webcam, and microphone
●   present valid government-issued photo ID that matches the name listed on the Exam
reservation (the Proctor will request that Candidate hold up their ID to the webcam) ●   read and accept the Exam Rules and the terms and conditions of Cloud Native
Computing Foundation Certification and Confidentiality Agreement

Upon completing the check-in process and when the proctor has verified that the candidate’s workstation environment and surroundings meet the requirements stipulated in Candidate Requirements, the proctor will release the exam so that the candidate can view exam content and begin working on their exam server. The countdown timer for the exam does not start until the proctor releases the exam.


Reporting Issues with Launching Exam
If the Launch Exam button does not appear or is not accessible within the 5-minute period following the Exam reservation’s scheduled start time, the candidate should contact the exam Proctoring Partner’s Support team using one of the following options:
●   “Online - Click here to get help” - this opens the chat support function
●   Support menu item in the top nav bar - call one of the support phone numbers

The Candidate must contact the Exam Proctoring Partner’s Support team within 15 minutes of the scheduled start time for their reservation to report an issue. Otherwise, they will be marked as a “No Show” for the Exam.


Exam Console Format
The Exam Console is composed of three main areas:


 

 

 

 

 
1.  Exam Console functions (menu bar across the top of the exam console) – houses functions to turn on screen- and webcam-sharing, start chat with proctor, and to access Exam Controls that include options to Show Testing Rules, Pause or End Exam, Refresh Exam Window, Reset Console, and access the Notepad.  (See Guidelines and Tips for Use of the Help Center below.)
2.  Content Panel (left) – contains exam objectives (the exam questions, tasks, etc.);
describes the point value of an objective; and displays a countdown timer for the exam.
3.  Linux Server Terminal (right) – panel that displays the terminal of a Linux server. (See
Guidelines and Tips for Use of the Linux Server Terminal below.)

Candidates will need to perform the exam objectives listed in the Content Panel by executing command-line tasks on the Linux server terminal. Proctors will be able to see the candidate’s desktop and view the candidate through the webcam.


Guidelines and Tips for Exam Console Functions in Top Menu Bar
●   To turn on webcam-sharing, click Camera from top menu. ●   To turn on screensharing, click Desktop from top menu.
●   To ask the proctor a question during the exam, select Live Chat from top menu. ●   Clicking Exam Controls from top menu offers the following choices:
○   Show Testing Rules: select this to review the exam rules during an exam. ○   Refresh Exam Window: use to refresh the Linux Server Terminal without
reloading the entire web page.
■   For example, if the Linux Server Terminal is experiencing latency issues that are not affecting the other functions of the Exam Console or Content panel, clicking the Refresh Exam Window button may help.
○   Reset Console: use to reset the HTML terminal application and to flush all
firewall settings on the candidate's server.
○   Pause Exam: use to request break from proctor. (Note: the exam timer continues
to run through even if proctor approves break request.)
○   End Exam: Candidate can use this to indicate to proctor they are ready to end
the exam.
○   Notepad: use this to make notes during the exam, e.g. keeping a list of items to revisit. Please note that notes entered here will not be retained or accessible after the exam has ended.


Guidelines and Tips for Use of the Content Panel
●   Exam objectives can be navigated linearly using the back and forth arrows or by using
the navigation drop down menu at the bottom of the Content Panel.
●   The timer in the content panel starts out at 180 minutes (CKA) or 120 minutes (CKAD) when the exam is released. Requesting a break via the Pause Exam function will not stop the timer.


 

 

 

 

 

 
○   Important Note: When a candidate’s connection to the exam console has to be restarted, it can cause the timer in the content panel to be reset to the beginning balance of 180 minutes (CKA) or 120 minutes (CKAD). The proctor keeps the ultimate timer for the exam. The candidate should check with the proctor for a true reading of time remaining in the exam if there is any doubt or in cases where the timer has reset.
●   The default language for exam objectives is English.



Guidelines and Tips for Use of the Linux server terminal
These instructions can also be pulled up during the exam by typing “man lf_exam” in the
command line.
1.  Root privileges can be obtained by running 'sudo -i'.
2.  Rebooting of your server IS permitted at anytime.
3.  Do not stop or tamper with the gateone process as this will END YOUR EXAM
SESSION.
4.  Do not block incoming ports 8080/tcp, 4505/tcp and 4506/tcp. This includes firewall rules that are found within the distribution's default firewall configuration files as well as interactive firewall commands.
5.  Many keyboard shortcuts will not work in the exam terminal. As an alternative,
candidates can use vi or emacs commands for handling shell commands.
6.  Use Ctrl+Alt+W instead of Ctrl+W. Ctrl+W is a keyboard shortcut that will close the
current tab in Google Chrome.
7.  Ctrl+C & and Ctrl+V are not supported in your exam terminal, nor is copy and pasting
large amounts of text. To copy and paste limited amounts of text (1-2 lines) please use; ○   For Linux: select text for copy and middle button for paste (or both left and right
simultaneously if you have no middle button). ○   For Mac: ⌘+C to copy and ⌘+V to paste.
○   For Windows: Ctrl+Insert to copy and Shift+Insert to paste.
8.  Installation of services and applications included in this exam may require modification of
system security policies to successfully complete.
9.  Only a single terminal console is available during the exam. Terminal multiplexers such
as GNU Screen and tmux can be used to create virtual consoles.

Be sure to also review how you can Practice Using the Exam’s Browser-Based Linux Server Terminal listed under Exam Preparation.


Duration of Exams
Candidates have three (3) hours to complete a Certified Kubernetes Administrator (CKA) exam. Candidates have two (2) hours to complete a Certified Kubernetes Application Developer (CKAD) exam.
 

 

 

 

 

 

 
As candidates proceed through the exam, a countdown timer is displayed at the top of the Content panel. The countdown timer does not start until proctor has released the exam to candidate (see Launching Exam). Additionally, the timer does not stop during requested breaks, and can sometimes reset to the beginning balance when candidate’s connection to exam console has to be restarted. Candidates can confirm the time remaining with the proctor directly. Please note that the proctor’s system (which isn’t visible to the candidate) is the system of record for time spent so in the unlikely event that your onscreen timer gets reset it does not affect your available time.


Language
Exam objectives (i.e. exam questions and tasks) are available in English.

All other aspects of the exam (e.g. the communication with proctor and the command-line terminal) will be presented and supported in English only. The alternative language options are available for just the exam questions in the Content Panel of the exam console.


Exam Scoring and Notification
Exams are scored automatically, usually within 24 hours of completion. Results will be emailed
36 hours from the time that the exam was completed. Results will also be made available on My Portal.

Exams are graded for results. There may be more than one way to perform an objective on an Exam and unless otherwise specified, the candidate can pick any available path to perform the objective as long as it produces the correct result.

The Cloud Native Computing Foundation will use statistical analyses of exam data (“Data Forensics”) to identify patterns indicative of test fraud including cheating and piracy. The Cloud Native Computing Foundation reserves the right to invalidate an exam score and certification result if review of an Exam record reveals scoring inaccuracies (attributable to the Cloud Native Computing Foundation or the Exam Proctoring Partner) or response patterns indicative of possible misconduct or measurement error. If The Cloud Native Computing Foundation determines that an exam score is invalid due to issues that are beyond the control of the candidate, the candidate will be advised of options to retake the exam at no charge.


Exam Results - Pass
Upon passing an exam and if all other requirements for certification have been met, candidates will be granted the certification relevant to the Exam. For example, passing the CKA Exam means a candidate will be granted CKA Certification, passing the CKAD Exam means a candidate will be granted a CKAD Certification.
 

 

 

 

 

 

 
Formal notice of successful certification from the Cloud Native Computing Foundation will be emailed within 3 business days of meeting program requirements. The notice will provide a Certificate ID number and include a pdf copy of the certificate, in addition to instructions on accessing additional Certification Marks.


Exam Results - No Pass
If eligible per the Retake Policy, candidates who do not achieve a passing score on their first attempt will be granted a free retake. Be sure sure to review the Retake Policy in full to understand eligibility and deadlines for the free retake. Instructions will be provided in the Exam Results notification on how to redeem the free retake.

If the free retake has been exhausted or if the exam is not eligible for free retake, candidates may register and pay to take the exam again, with no discount given for such additional retakes.

Candidates may also wish to consider taking optional training to help them prepare for the certification exam.


Exam Rescoring Requests
Though we cannot guarantee the availability of rescoring for an exam server, candidates may make a request for an exam to be rescored up to 2 days following the date on which the exam was taken. The fee for rescoring an exam is $50 USD and may be paid via credit card. Rescoring requests should be made via email to certificationsupport@cncf.io and must include the Candidate name, Linux Foundation ID, Exam Title, and Date exam was taken.

If the rescoring results in a change from No Pass to Pass on the exam, the rescoring fee will be refunded.


Retake Policy
For certification exams purchased directly from the Cloud Native Computing Foundation one (1) free retake per exam purchase will be granted in the event that a passing score is not achieved and Candidate has not otherwise been deemed ineligible for certification or retake. Unless otherwise indicated in the exam order, the free retake must be completed within 12 months of the
 
date of the original exam purchase.  After the free retake has been exhausted or the deadline to
 
complete the free retake has passed, Candidates may register and pay to take the exam again, with no discount given for such additional retakes.

Candidates MUST start their exam no later than 15 minutes after the scheduled start time. If a candidate does not start their exam within 15 minutes of the scheduled start time, they will be automatically marked as a no-show and no refund or rescheduling will be allowed. (See Reporting Issues with Launching Exam.)

Before the exam can be released, candidates are presented with rules regarding their testing location and candidate conduct during the exam, and with the policy on warnings and Exam terminations. The Proctor cannot release the exam until the candidate has indicated that they have read, understood and accept these rules.


Testing Location Policy
●   Room must be quiet, private and well lit
●   Bright lights or windows should not be positioned behind the Candidate
●   Testing from public spaces such as coffee shops, stores, etc. is not allowed ●   No one other than the candidate can be present in the room
●   Desk must be clear of all notes and electronics


Rules During Exam
●   Candidate should review the exam content instructions that are presented in the command line terminal; candidate can also type “man lf_exam” in the command line to view instructions again at any time during the exam
●   Candidate is not allowed to communicate with anyone other than the proctor during the
exam

No other tabs may be opened, no other sites may be navigated to, and only kubernetes.io assets may be accessed. The allowed sites above may contain links that point to external sites. It is the responsibility of the candidate not to click on any links that cause them to navigate to a domain that is not allowed.
●


 

 

 

 

 

 
●   Candidate is not allowed to look away from their exam console screen for extended
periods of time
●   Candidate must refrain from making excessive and/or repetitive noise

device, etc.) outside of the exam console screen
●   Candidates must comply with any requests from the proctor. If candidate fails to comply,
the exam will be terminated *unless medically necessary

Policy on Warnings and Exam Terminations
Certain kinds of violations will result in a warning from the proctor, while certain other violations result in IMMEDIATE TERMINATION OF THE EXAM WITHOUT WARNING.

If a warning is issued by the proctor, the exam will be paused until the candidate is able to amend or resolve the observed violation.

If a candidate is found to be in violation of the same rule more than twice or is found to be in violation more than four times on any combination of rules, the exam will be terminated immediately.

The following actions will result in IMMEDIATE TERMINATION OF THE EXAM WITHOUT WARNING:

●   Candidate refuses to comply with a proctor request

device(s), manual transcription, or other means
●   Candidate steps out of view of the webcam for extended amount of time without the
proctor’s permission
●   Someone other than the candidate is observed to complete or assist with any part of the
exam
●   A discrepancy exists between the input on a candidate’s screen and the candidate’s
observed activity


Policy on Tools and Resources During Exams
The following tools and resources are allowed during the exam as long as they are used by candidate to work independently on exam objectives (i.e. not used for 3rd party assistance or research) and are accessed from the shared screen which the proctor can observe (accessing resources which are not visible to the proctor will be treated as a serious violation). Candidate may:
●   review the Exam content instructions that are presented in the command line terminal.


 

 

 
●   type “man lf_exam” in the command line to view instructions again at any time during the
Exam.
●   Candidates may use their Chrome or Chromium browser to open one additional tab in order to access assets on the kubernetes.io domain for reference during the exam. No other tabs may be opened, no other sites may be navigated to. The allowed sites above may contain links that point to external sites. It is the responsibility of the candidate not to click on any links that cause them to navigate to a domain that is not allowed..

●   Notepads (other than what’s provided within the exam browser tab) ●   Course manuals
●   Devices external to computer on which they are taking the exam, including but not
limited to: mobile phones, PDAs, wearable computers, smart glasses, smart watches ●   Exam-specific assets, meaning those created by (or with the assistance of) those with
prior exposure to the exam content and for the purpose of providing specific assistance to a candidate taking the CKA or CKAD exam.

The goal is to provide a real world experience and candidates should not be apprehensive about using assets that they'd normally use in the course of doing their job. If use of a particular asset is flagged by the review process the candidate will have an opportunity to respond to any
proposed sanction. As with any skills evaluation, please just use good judgment while taking the exam.

Exam Misconduct
Candidates engaging in exam misconduct will not be allowed to complete the exam or receive an exam result. Such candidates may also be barred from taking any other Cloud Native Computing Foundation Certification Exam and if applicable, may have their Cloud Native Computing Foundation Certification withdrawn. Refunds will not be given and rescheduling will not be allowed if an exam is terminated early or could not be started on time due to exam misconduct. Misconduct may, at any time, result in application of sanctions.

Certificates and Certification
 

 

 
Certified Candidates (“Certificants”) receive a Certificate ID number and a certificate indicating their successful completion of the requirements necessary to achieve the title, CKA or CKAD, indicated on their certificate. Certifications expire 24 months from the date that a certificant successfully passes their certification exam, unless revoked earlier for cause or certificant successfully completes certification renewal requirements. The primary method for confirming the status of a certification is to use the Cloud Native Computing Foundation’s Certification Verification Tool.

While their certification status is active,
●   CKA certificants may use the term Certified Kubernetes Administrator to refer to
themselves
●   CKAD certificants may use the term Certified Kubernetes Application Developer to refer
to themselves

Certificate
The CKA Certificate lists the following information:
○   Name of the Candidate who obtained the certificate
○   Title of Certification (e.g. Certified Kubernetes Administrator) ○   Certificate ID number
○   Date of Completion (i.e. date Exam was passed)

The CKAD Certificate lists the following information:
○   Name of the Candidate who obtained the certificate
○   Title of Certification (e.g. Certified Kubernetes Application Developer) ○   Certificate ID number
○   Date of Completion (i.e. date Exam was passed)


Certification Verification Tool
The Cloud Native Computing Foundation provides a verification tool on its website that allows users (e.g. potential employers or clients) to validate the status of an individual’s certification. To submit a query on this verification tool, a user must enter the Certificate ID number and the Last Name listed on the certificate of a successfully certified individual. (The Last Name must be entered exactly as listed on the Certificate, including any special characters.) The result for a successfully submitted query will include the full name of certificant, certification title and status (active/inactive), and the date that the certification was achieved.


Certification Expiration
Certifications expire 24 months from the date that the Program Certification requirements are met by a candidate. Certificants must meet renewal requirements prior to the expiration date of their current certification in order to maintain active certification. If certification renewal requirements are not completed before the expiration date, certification will be revoked.

Exam Preparation

Examination Content Outline
An overview of domains and competencies for the Certified Kubernetes Administrator and Certified Kubernetes Application Develops Exams can be found here: https://cncf.io/certification/curriculum


Studying for the Exam
The Cloud Native Computing Foundation’s certification exams are performance-based, which means the only way to ‘study’ for them is to practice, practice, practice. The overview of domains and competencies listed for each certification exam provides guidance on the topics covered in an exam. Candidates are encouraged to gain as much hands-on experience as possible in order to build mastery using the command line (since the exam terminal does not use the graphical interface). As indicated in Other Resources, there are many forums, both online and offline, which prospective candidates may find useful in building skills on their chosen distribution. Some candidates, especially those who are newer to Kubernetes, may also find it valuable to complete a formal training course. The Cloud Native Computing Foundation provides (via The Linux Foundation) optional test preparation courses that cover the relevant material. These are prepared by an independent team using the publicly available content outline for exams. They do not claim to provide specific coverage of exam items, nor do they claim to make it faster, cheaper or easier to pass the exam.

Candidates may also choose training from 3rd-party training providers, all of whom have access to the same content outline as the Cloud Native Computing Foundation course development team.


Info on the Exam’s Browser-Based Linux Server Terminal
Since the exam terminal is delivered in your browser, it will behave slightly different than an SSH client or local install. Aside from the known issues with certain keyboard shortcuts already mentioned in the “Guidelines and Tips for Use of the Linux server terminal” section, there may be some other keyboard shortcuts that present issues for some candidates. If you’d like to get more information on Gate One, which is used to deliver the terminal in your exam console, please visit the following link - https://github.com/liftoff/GateOne

Appeals

Appeals policy
In the event that sanctions are imposed, e.g. for Exam Misconduct, candidates will have thirty
(30) calendar days from the date of their notification letter to file an appeal. A Certification Appeals Submission Form will also be provided. If the Candidate believes they have valid grounds for an appeal, they may complete the submission requirements for the Certification Appeals Submission Form and submit it as instructed.

Incomplete submissions and submissions received after the thirty (30) calendar period will not be considered. If the Cloud Native Computing Foundation determines that a written request for appeal is filed within the allowable time and follows required guidelines for consideration, and the original sanction decision is upheld by the Cloud Native Computing Foundation, such appeal and the information submitted by the Candidate will be forwarded to the Cloud Native
Computing Foundation Certification Appeals Committee for consideration. 

 

 

 

 
Appeals Decisions
You may expect to receive a written response from the Cloud Native Computing Foundation within ninety (90) calendar days after the Appeals Committee meets. Decisions rendered by the Appeals Committee are final.
